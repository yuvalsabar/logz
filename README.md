=================

- I had some time limitations, so I didn't finish everything. Many blocks are missing, and there is no mobile navigation. That is why I urge you to visit my portfolio and ask me for links to websites I built in order to review my works. I can also collaborate you guys with git repo's if you'd like :)
- I follow BEM standards for class names
- I follow WP standards for PHP
- Usually, I'm use automation tools such as yarn to compile scss, lint php, js and css. I didn't have much time here, so I used my IDE linters in VScode
- There is no search box in the design, so I did not added the icon.
- Size of design is 1440px. This rise questions on how full-width sections and backgrounds should look like in 1920px, that is why I usually ask for designs at 1920px in the first place. In this case, I did not want to make you bother, but beware there are maybe some gaps here because of this issue.
- Header was a little bit messy in the design (https://i.imgur.com/j44TOgA.png), I fixed whatever needed fixing
- I'm using ACF Blocks in order to make code as reusable and scaleable as I can. For page templates, I use WP built-in Reusable Blocks and build the template as few reusable blocks. That is of course one approach, and some content editors prefer using custom page templates. I familiar with all kinds of approaches and demands.
- Since sometimes spacings between the blocks may be vary in different pages, there are general settings in the all of the blocks that allows the admin to set margins. Admin can also set different margins for mobile view.
- Request a demo form - Doesn't have the same fields as in the design. Also, I think it should be managed globally, but in the scope you have mentioned it should be different in every page, so this is what I did.
